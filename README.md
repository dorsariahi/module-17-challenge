## Computer Science for JavaScript Challenge: Regex Tutorial

# Description
What does "regex" mean? It's short for "regular expression" which in programming or computer science is used to define a search pattern in text form (or rather, in the form of a string.) Even that definition can cause some pause, so I'll elaborate further to say that these expressions are capable of matching a portion of a string and therefore validating that a given input matches a specified criteria or set of rules.
